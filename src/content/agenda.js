          ABSTRACT: 
          <p>
            The economists Brynjolfsson and McAfee ask if simulating brain power with AI will be as big a disruption to employment as simulating muscle with machines was in the industrial revolution.  Likewise, Friedman writes that there is a mismatch between the pace of change and our ability to develop the learning systems that would enable citizens to get the most out of these accelerations and cushion their worst impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find it interesting that economists are the ones who are calling for AI to help everyday people learn how to learn better in the face of the changes that AI is bringing.
          </p>
          <p>
            What kinds of breakthroughs would we achieve if a large proportion of AI researchers, perhaps working in tandem with HCI researchers and learning scientists, focused large portions of their energy on figuring out a real breakthrough in helping people learn new things in a better, more effective way?  
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is that every time someone thought about attempting to learn something new, their next immediate thought was:  “No problem, I can do that!”  And that thought would be merited.

          <p>
            What do we mean when we talk about class? I will discuss the role of social class, or ‘socioeconomic status’ (SES), in technology design and evaluation. While studies along socioeconomic lines are common in the social sciences, such approaches are more rare in human-computer interaction and technology design where “middle-class” has long been the invisible default. This research challenges the tendency to design for users whose lives resemble designers’ by discussing issues of power, culture, and resource access.
